    "LLMs can reason over tabular data in 2 main ways:\n",
    "1. textual reasoning via direct prompting\n",
    "2. symbolic reasoning via program synthesis (e.g. python, SQL, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight of the paper is that different reasoning pathways work well in different tasks. By aggregating results from both with a self-consistency mechanism (i.e. majority voting), it achieves SoTA performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented the paper based on the prompts described in the paper, and adapted it to get it working. That said, this is marked as beta, so there may still be kinks to work through. Do you have suggestions / contributions on how to improve the robustness? Let us know! "
